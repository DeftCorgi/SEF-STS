NOTES ON THE CODE

? In Storage.java the loadCourseFile() seems a) out of place (this has nothing to do with stoage) and b) I'm not even sure why we have it...

!!! In User, course completion is always returned as false, that doesn't sound right...

!!! In Coordinator, checkProgramRequirements() is empty
? checkProgramCompletion() seems a bit weird but that might just be me. Shouldn't we check if the student has re-taken a course?
!!! meetsProgramRequirements() is not implemented properly


!!! When we go into edit Program via the menu (Coordinator only I think), we should have options to edit/delete specializations, coreCourses and really anything.
