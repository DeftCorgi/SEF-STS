/*It's hard to say who specifically did what when referring to the source code since everyone did what they can. It was easier for us to do small blocks of code at a time, with another person continuing what another one has done.*/
/*I (Ana Teo) also had to generalize what each one did because my groupmates are not replying to my messages anymore, given that it's already 12:20am*/
/*Generally speaking, the work was divided equally amongst the members, so 25% each*/
